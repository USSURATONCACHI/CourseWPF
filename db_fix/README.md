# db_fix

Really simple single-executable rust utility, that fixes SQLite tables where numbers are stored as TEXT data type.

Executable is checked-in the repo alongside sources, so I do not have to incorporate rust cargo into C# .csproj file. And you do not have to have cargo installed to build the project.
